					<div class="post-content">
					<p>You might be thinking, “Whoa! Seriously?”</p>
					<p>Seriously.</p>
					<p>While no reported cases to date have actually found an employer vicariously liable to a scorned spouse for the adulterous relationship between the cheating spouse and a coworker, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has left that possibility open.</p>
					<p>North Carolina is one of few states that still recognize common law alienation of affection claims. Alienation of affection is a type of personal injury claim whereby a plaintiff spouse could recover against a third party paramour for robbing the victim of her spouse’s affection or companionship. These kinds of claims were born in the days when wives were considered a man’s property, and so to pursue an affair with a man’s wife would be to deprive the man of the use of his property. While the law has evolved such that it no longer discriminates on the basis of sex, many continue to criticize it because of its history and its purposes.</p>
					<p>The Court of Appeals suggested in a case called <em>Mercier v. Daniels</em> way back in 2000 that it is conceivable that an employer could be found liable for alienation if: (1) it knew about the adulterous relationship among its employees, and (2) took actions to ratify (approve of) the adulterous affair.</p>
					<p>For example, let’s say that in the legendary law firm of Dewey, Cheatham &amp; Howe, a married associate attorney begins having an affair with the managing paralegal. The affair continues for a few years, and the rumor mill starts. It becomes fairly obvious to the managing partners of the law firm that an adulterous relationship occurring between the two employees. Instead of discussing the matter with the married employee, the firm instead begins to take affirmative actions to cover up the affair and allow it to continue. The managing partners pair the two in the same hotel room at conferences when the attorney’s wife doesn’t attend. The partners cover for the attorney when his wife calls the office, telling her that the attorney had to work late again. The affair continues for 10 years. Eventually, the attorney’s wife finds out.</p>
					<p>In the above scenario, the law firm could very well face liability for ratifying the adulterous relationship of its employees. In essence, the firm has aided and abetted the adulterous relationship. In fact, the Court of Appeals even hinted that it might only take a knowing employer <em>failing to intervene</em> to create vicarious liability.</p>
					<p>The takeaway for employers: If you know about a workplace affair, take steps to show that you do not intend to ratify it. Express disapproval of the relationship, document efforts to discourage it, and distance yourself from it.</p>
					<p>The takeaway for philandering employees: You know better.</p>
